### Definition

A geophone is a seismic sensor that converts ground vibrations into an electrical signal. It works using a mass suspended inside a coil or a magnet: when the ground vibrates, the difference in movement between the mass and the housing generates an electrical current proportional to the velocity of the ground motion.

Geophones are used in seismology to detect earthquakes, in geophysics for oil exploration, and in engineering to monitor infrastructure vibrations.

The idea here is to use it to record ground and object vibrations, as well as natural sounds, in the context of field recording or sound experimentation. Unlike a piezo microphone, the geophone focuses on low frequencies because it is less sensitive to high frequencies.

### Build information

Printed in [PLA-CF](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/fr-fr/collections/pla/products/pla-cf), but work nice with PETG (witch seems more convinent for outside work) Notheless, I didn't had annt humidity trouble with the PLA. The structur is thick enought to protect the sensor and all the joint arehelping to that. But it's not meat to be underwater. For that, I recomend you the nice DIY [tutorial for an hydrophone](https://www.instructables.com/Lets-Build-Some-World-Class-Hydrophones/).
